# Cryptography: Attacks, Services, and Mechanisms

## 1. Introduction to Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of securing information by converting it into an unreadable form so that only authorized users can access it.

- **Plaintext**: Original readable message  
- **Ciphertext**: Encrypted unreadable message  
- **Encryption**: Converting plaintext to ciphertext  
- **Decryption**: Converting ciphertext back to plaintext

## 2. Cryptographic Attacks
A cryptographic attack is an attempt to break the security of a cryptographic system.

### 2.1 Passive Attacks
Passive attacks involve monitoring communication without altering data.

#### a) Eavesdropping
- Attacker secretly listens to communication.
- Common in unsecured networks.

#### b) Traffic Analysis
- Attacker observes communication patterns like frequency and size.
- Even encrypted data can leak information.

**Goal:** Gain information without detection.

### 2.2 Active Attacks
Active attacks involve modifying or disrupting data.

#### a) Masquerade
- Attacker pretends to be a legitimate user.

#### b) Replay Attack
- Captured messages are resent later to gain unauthorized access.

#### c) Message Modification
- Attacker alters message content during transmission.

#### d) Denial of Service (DoS)
- Attacker overloads the system to make it unavailable.

**Goal:** Modify, destroy, or disrupt communication.

## 3. Cryptographic Services
Cryptographic services provide security to information systems.

### 3.1 Confidentiality
- Ensures only authorized users can access data.
- Achieved using encryption.

### 3.2 Authentication
- Verifies the identity of communicating parties.

### 3.3 Integrity
- Ensures data is not altered during transmission.
- Implemented using hash functions.

### 3.4 Non-Repudiation
- Prevents sender from denying message transmission.
- Achieved using digital signatures.

### 3.5 Access Control
- Restricts access to authorized users only.

## 4. Cryptographic Mechanisms
Cryptographic mechanisms are techniques used to provide cryptographic services.

### 4.1 Encryption Mechanism
- Converts plaintext into ciphertext.
- Types:
  - **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption.
  - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses public and private keys.

### 4.2 Digital Signature
- Provides authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
- Uses private key for signing and public key for verification.

### 4.3 Hash Functions
- Converts data into a fixed-length hash value.
- Any change in data results in a different hash.
- Examples: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.

### 4.4 Key Management
- Involves generation, distribution, storage, and revocation of keys.

### 4.5 Authentication Exchange
- Ensures identity verification before communication.
- Example: Challenge-response mechanism.
